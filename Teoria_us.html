                        <p>They are direct materials and direct labor. These costs are directly related to production. For example, the cost of labor (doctors, nurses, etc.) and direct materials (examination and treatment) Amount of direct material and direct labor involved in the manufacture of a product.</p>

                        <p>To determine the cost incurred by a company to manufacture a product, a record and control must be kept of all the elements that make up that cost, including the raw material needed in the preparation of your product. Now, to process the raw material, it requires personnel that directly manipulate and process the raw material; It is what is known as direct labor. Within direct labor, as is obvious, personnel expenses that do not participate directly in the process of transforming the raw material, such as secretaries, salespersons, managers, etc., are not included. Within the personnel expenses that make up the direct labor, all the concepts paid to them are included, such as salaries, social benefits, social security, parafiscal contributions, endowment,</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Production costs are monetary estimates of all expenses that have been made within the company, for the development of a good. These expenses include everything related to labor, costs of materials, as well as all indirect costs that in some way contribute to the manufacture of a good.</p>

                        <br>

                        <p>A company to achieve its goals must obtain from its environment the elements it needs for the production of a good or service, among which are: labor, raw materials, machinery, capital, etc.</p>

                        <br><br>

                        <p><b>The production costs are divided into:</b></p>

                        <br>

                        <p><b>Fixed costs:</b>they are the permanent costs of the company, so their disbursement is not subject to the level of production, that is, if the company produces or not, they must be paid equally. For example: payments for rent, salaries and salaries, utility expenses (electricity, water, telephone, etc.)</p>

                        <br>

                        <p><b>Variable costs:</b>those that can be increased or decreased, depending on the degree of production. For example: the raw material, if the sales of a product increase, then you will need much more raw material to make it, or on the contrary, if the sales of a product decrease, you will not need much raw material. The same happens with the containers, since their quantity will obey the quantity of goods manufactured.</p>

                        <br><br>

                        <p><b>Total cost:</b> It is the sum of the fixed and variable costs.</p>

                        <br>

                        <p><b>Marginal cost:</b> represents the variation rate of the total cost, before the increase of one unit produced. For example: if the total cost to produce 50 products is 100 pesos and the total cost to manufacture 51 products is 115 pesos, that is, the marginal cost is 15 pesos.</p>

                        <p>Indirect costs are those that are not directly attributable to the production of a particular product or service. Among them, some authors distinguish between so-called semidirects, when in spite of not being able to be attributed to a specific product or service, they can be imputed to a specific cost center or department. And, the indirect ones, which would then be those that it is not possible to impute to a specific product or service, or to any specific cost center or department.</p>

                        <br>

                        <p>In addition, it is usual to distinguish between indirect costs of production, which are those costs not directly involved in production but necessary for it, such as indirect labor. And, the general indirect costs, which, in turn, are usually divided into several groups. such as indirect business costs, indirect costs of administration, and indirect costs of a financial nature.</p>

                            <p>To understand better, let's review with this case study.</p>

                            <br>

                            <p>The company Mermeladas Forex mt4 SA has Fixed costs (salaries: s / 1,300, local rent s / 500, water and electricity s / 100), and Variable Costs (Strawberries s / 200, Piña s / 200, containers s / 50, gas s / 30). It is requested that the total and unit cost of production be calculated.</p>

                            <br>

                            <p><b>Total cost</b> = 1,900 + 480 = S/ 2,380</p>

                            <br>

                            <p>It is known that the company Mermeladas Forex mt4 SA has projected that it will produce 450 jams.</p>

                            <br>

                            <p><b>Unit Cost</b> = 2,380 / 450 = 5.29</p>

                            <p>Therefore, the unit cost of each jam is s / 5.29 so now you only have to establish a% of profits for each product.</p>
